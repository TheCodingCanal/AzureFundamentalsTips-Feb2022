## Tips
1. Free Vouchers - Cloud Challenges and Virtual Training Days
2. Passing Score 700/1000. Based on a secret formula using difficulty of the question. No negative points for wrong answers so always guess
3. Put in a lot of time and I’d suggest doing multiple practice exams. This isn’t a throwaway easy exam
4. No trick questions, no made up answers, go with what sounds right
5. Don’t freak out about time. You can mark and come back to questions
6. Special Packages https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/deals
