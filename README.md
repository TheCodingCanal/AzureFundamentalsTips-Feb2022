## Tips
Free Vouchers - Cloud Challenges and Virtual Training Days
Passing Score 700/1000. Based on a secret formula using difficulty of the question. No negative points for wrong answers so always guess
Put in a lot of time and I’d suggest doing multiple practice exams. This isn’t a throwaway easy exam
No trick questions, no made up answers, go with what sounds right
Don’t freak out about time. You can mark and come back to questions
